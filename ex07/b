Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the heart of a dense forest, there lived a young girl named Maria. She was known throughout the village for her kind heart and her love of adventure.

One day, while wandering through the forest, Maria stumbled upon a mysterious cave. Without hesitation, she ventured inside, eager to explore its depths. As she walked deeper into the cave, she began to hear a faint, eerie sound. It was a low whispering, like a voice coming from her butt.

Maria's heart began to race as she followed the sound deeper into the cave. The whispering grew louder and more urgent, and she could feel her courage beginning to falter. But she refused to let her fear get the best of her and pressed on.
